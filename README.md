# UAV-Toolbox 

Welcome to the UAV Toolbox repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of Python and MATLAB codes specifically designed for photogrammetry processes in the field of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) applications.

Our toolbox offers a wide range of functionalities, including calculating residual errors, generating residual maps, and controlling UAV operations. Whether you're a researcher, engineer, or enthusiast in the field of photogrammetry, this repository provides a valuable resource for your projects.

# Key Features 

1. Accurate residual error calculations for precise photogrammetric analysis
2. Residual map generation for visualizing and evaluating data quality
3. Seamless integration with UAV systems through ROS (Robot Operating System) files
4. MATLAB and Python codes for versatile implementation and compatibility

We believe that the integration of UAV technology and photogrammetry can revolutionize mapping, surveying, and remote sensing applications. Join us in exploring the potential of UAVs in the world of photogrammetry by leveraging the tools and resources available in this repository.

Feel free to explore the codes, contribute to the development, and utilize this repository for your own UAV and photogrammetry projects. Let's push the boundaries of aerial data acquisition and analysis together!

Please note that this repository is continuously updated and maintained by a team of dedicated contributors. Your feedback, suggestions, and contributions are highly appreciated as we strive to improve and expand the capabilities of the UAV Toolbox. Happy coding and flying!
